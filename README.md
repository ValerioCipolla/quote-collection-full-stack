# quote-generator-full-stack
A full-stack random quote generator made using JS, Node.js and PostegreSQL

## School of Code Christmas Project
As a project through the christmas break I decided to create a simple application to work on all the skill we have learned so far (6 weeks into the bootcamp).
In my project I will use JS for the front-end (I might look at ReactJS if I have enough time), Node.js for the server and PostegreSQL as a database platform. 

## MVP
As an MVP I want my application to fetch the data (quote and author of the quote) from a database and at the click of a button change the quote displayed to the next one in the database.

## Bonus 1
I want my application to allow users to create a new quote and store it in the database, so that it will eventually be displayed on the screen.

## Bonus 2 
I want my application to allow users to delete quotes from the database so they will no longer be displayed.

## Bonus 3
I want to allow users to email the quotes they like to themselves (or to other people) using Node.js

## Bonus 4 
Use reactJS for the front-end.
